### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Hasan, a software engineer based in Istanbul, Turkey.

I'm enthusiastic about writing clean, reusable, maintainable and high performance code. 

I like to solve problems and learn new things everyday. 

:computer: Currently, I'm working at [Lifemote](https://github.com/lifemote), mainly using Python and AWS technologies to make things work at backend.
